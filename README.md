## Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic beginner-level competition on Kaggle. The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on attributes such as age, gender, class, and embarkation port.
This project uses Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers, evaluating them with stratified train/validation splits and selecting the best model based on validation accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggleâ€™s Titanic competition.

train.csv: Training data with labels (Survived).
test.csv: Test data used for predictions.
